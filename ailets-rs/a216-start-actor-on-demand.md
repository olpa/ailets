# A216: Start Actor On Demand

## Task

Implement on-demand actor spawning and maximum concurrency for the executor system.

## Requirements

### spec://executor/executor.md#on-demand-spawn

Actor spawning is deferred until input is available. This prevents premature resource allocation for nodes that may never execute.

### spec://executor/executor.md#maximum-concurrency

The system runs as many actors concurrently as possible. Parallelism is limited only by spec://executor/executor.md#on-demand-spawn and dependency constraints.

## Implementation Progress

### Analysis
- [ ] Understand current spawning behavior in `Environment::spawn_actor_tasks`
- [ ] Identify how to detect when input becomes available for a node
- [ ] Design mechanism for triggering actor spawn on input availability
- [ ] Determine how to maintain maximum concurrency

### Implementation
- [ ] TODO

### Testing
- [ ] TODO
